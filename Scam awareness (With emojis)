Hey everyone,

As part of our community, it's crucial to stay vigilant and protect ourselves from phishing links, scam emails, and other fraudulent activities. These scams can compromise your personal information, steal your accounts, and cause significant harm.

Here are some key points to keep in mind:

1. **Be Skeptical of Unsolicited Messages**: If you receive a message from someone you don't know or even from someone you know that seems unusual, be cautious. Scammers can impersonate friends and trusted sources.

2. **Verify Links Before Clicking**: Always hover over links to see the URL before clicking. If it looks suspicious or unfamiliar, don't click on it. It's better to be safe than sorry.

3. **Protect Your Personal Information**: Never share your personal details, passwords, or any sensitive information through messages or emails. Legitimate organizations will never ask for this information in such a way.

4. **Never Scan Unofficial QR Codes**: Only scan the login QR code from the official Discord site. Scanning a QR code from a suspicious source can compromise your account. It's safer to use the normal login method (username and password) as this does not bypass Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).

5. **Use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Enable 2FA on your accounts wherever possible. This adds an extra layer of security and makes it harder for scammers to gain access.

6. **Stay Informed**: Educate yourself about common scams and phishing tactics. Awareness is your first line of defense.
